I started heavy work on Qodot, so it would be able to read PatchDef2 (bezier curves used to implement basic geometry such as terrain, pillars, arches, etc.), which is required for Quake 3, Xonotic and many other open source game maps like Warsow and what not to work. There are tens of thousands of community maps for those games and each map takes like dozens if not hundreds of hours to create, so it seemed really worthwhile to do this.

However since the implementation was quite time-consuming, in this time first there was totally unrelated drama with the devs, then Qodot was radically rewritten (ditched C# in favor of GDScript). Since everything I wrote was in C#, plus the drama, this code is basically now dead, which is pretty sad. I would like to resume this project, but it would require the Qodot devs to come forward and resolve the trust issues they created first.

*However, you can still load Xonotic and Quake 3 maps with this repository if you follow those steps.*

The same method can also be used with mainline Qodot, if you put a simple "try .. catch" inside the map parser, so it will not die when parsing patches. However, since the upstream Qodot has no patch support, the results might be too poor with the majority of maps to be playable. With this project you will get quite passable results mostly.

# making it work

If you are not on Linux, use MSYS2 for the bash scripts.

1. If you only have a .bsp, use q3map2 to convert to .map like so (-game parameter is not ultimately necessary):

```
q3map2 -convert -format map -game xonotic toxic_fabric.bsp
```

2. Now in [Netradiant-custom](https://garux.github.io/NRC/), open the .map file. You might need to configure netradiant-custom for your game first.

3. Open a second window of Netradiant-custom, go to Edit->Preferences->Brush and set "New map Brush Type" to "Valve 220".

4. In the first window, go to View->Filter and check Hints and Clips and what not so it only shows solid geometry, spawn points, lights and weapons and such (for testing purposes). Now hold down CTRL + right mouse button to select the entire map and CTRL+C to copy the contents.

5. Paste the contents in the second window with the Valve 220 format.

6. Save the map like so in your new Godot game folder: toxic_fabric_valve.map

7. use this makeshift script inside your Godot folder, which tries to pull all the textures required into your Godot project and rename them inside the .map file to make sense to Godot:

   ```
   # Please change "/mnt/2/xonotic_tga/dds/textures/ /usr/share/xonotic/data/textures/" to your texture dir of the game
   mkdir textures
   MAP=toxic_fabric_valve.map; cp "$MAP" "${MAP%.*}-godot.map"; for i in `grep -osaE "[^/[:space:]]+/[^/[:space:]]+" "$MAP"  | sort -u | uniq`; do FILEN="$(echo $i | sed -En "s#.*/([^/]*)+\$#\1#gp" | sed "s#-#_#g")"; FILEN2="$(echo $i | sed "s#-#/#g" | sed -En "s#.*/([^/]*)+\$#\1#gp")"; FILEP="$(echo $i | sed "s#-#/#g" | sed -En "s#(.*)+/[^/]*\$#\1#gp")"; ACTUAL="$(find /mnt/2/xonotic_tga/dds/textures/ /usr/share/xonotic/data/textures/ -iregex ".*${FILEP}/${FILEN}\.\(tga\|png\|jpg\|jpeg\)" -or -iregex ".*${FILEP}/${FILEN2}\.\(tga\|png\|jpg\|jpeg\)" -or -iregex ".*$i\.\(tga\|png\|jpg\|jpeg\)" | head -n 1)"; if [[ "$ACTUAL" == "" ]]; then echo "Not found: ${FILEP}/${FILEN} ($i)"; else echo "Found: '$ACTUAL'"; sed -Ei "s#${i}#/${FILEP}/${FILEN}#g" "${MAP%.*}-godot.map"; mkdir -p textures/${FILEP}; convert "$ACTUAL" textures/${FILEP}/${FILEN}.png; fi; done
   ```
Please note that this will only work for basic textures, not shaders like sky or water. Though if the names in the .shader file match the .png/jpg name somewhat (often they do) then it will still show the basic texture for it. With most maps that's just fine and playable. 

8. Download the [.NET build of Godot](https://godotengine.org/download) and use this one, instead of the regular one.

9. Clone this repo into your Godot game and then enable it in Project settings.

10. Follow the old Qodot tutorial to load your map. Basically go to Tools->C#->create C# solution, then press ALT + B, then create a QodotMap node.

11. In the inspector on the Qodot node, choose your -godot.map (e.g. toxic_fabric_valve-godot.map) as map_file and enable use_experimental_regex_parser. The parameter patch_tesselation_level controls how smooth the curves will be. Choose 4 for testing purposes.

12. Now in the 3D viewer in the top toolbar, there are (like usual with Qodot) three new buttons. Press "Full Build".

13. Your map is now imported, like usual. If a lot of brushes are missing, it means your map is not Valve 220 format.

# So I have loaded the .map, now what?

Well, you will notice obviously that there is only the geometry loaded and that you still write a lot of code to make all the features of the game work. Like jumppads, doors, spawn points, 3D models, etc.

In order to accomplish this, the easiest way is to make a post-processing @tool script that connects to the signal "build_complete()" on the QuodotMap node. Here is some stuff I started for a game project of mine (only experiment/testing) to give you some idea how it works. You will immediately see everything in the editor once you press the build button in Qodot. Note that the map was made with a custom game definition in Netradiant specifically for my game, and it's not an old community map. It uses .glTF models, which Netradiant-Custom can also understand. But Quake-style maps use .md3 models or other formats, such as .iqm, which need to be manually converted to .glTF for Godot to understand.

# further information on the .map format

Qodot can only parse the old Quake 1 map format and the Half-Life 1 Valve 220 format, which is basically just a bunch of 3D box shapes (aka brushes) with (less advanced) texture clamping plus entry definitions for like spawn points, weapons, 3D models, etc. Door triggers, invisible walls, lights, etc. are just a result of giving those two basic components custom names and properties that the game engine can make sense of, for example "model_scale" or "color" for light sources. PatchDef is basically a definition of a mesh with uv clamping that translates into a bunch of 3x3 meshes and which are made to have smooth curves based on super-custom bezier curve math. In Quake 3 you will find the new BrushDef to replace the old-style brush definitions, which uses more complicated abstract math that no one really can make sense of anymore. In Doom 3 and Quake 4 they even made this math 4-dimensional, so again the brush definitions are incompatible. But you will not find many community maps for those games. Luckily all maps can be converted to Valve 220 with Netradiant Custom, and for some oddball retro games like Heavy Metal Fuck, there is even another tool called QuArK to convert those to something Netradiant might understand. Please note that the .map format defines geometry in a highly custom manner that cannot be understood by any tool or 3D program in any way, if it was not specifically designed for this purpose. In fact it seems absolutely ridiculous nowadays how complicated the math involved is, just to save like a few MB of RAM and disk space, it caused like thousands of lines of extra code to be necessary that are not easily understood at all without an IQ of like 145 or more. Which is one of the main reasons why modern tools just don't fully support the modern variations of the .map format, and basically only Netradiant and Quark can really make sense of it.
